                    love be with you (two, one, liftoff). This is Ground Control to Major Tom.
                    You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts
                    you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom to
                    Ground Control. I'm stepping through the door.</p></div>
